# Product-line separation (security / life / clean).
#
# eufy ships several ecosystems that share a cloud account and nothing else. They must not leak into
# each other, and the leak is easy to introduce because their retail vocabulary overlaps and detection
# evidence is OR-ed. Two structural rules are checked here; the behavioural one (a capability never
# landing on another line's codec) is covered by capabilities/__tests__/line-partition.spec.ts.
#
#   1. Every capability module states its line, or inherits the `security` default. A module that
#      names another line's wire vocabulary while sitting on the default is the leak this catches.
#   2. No capability names an MQTT topic. Topics are transport vocabulary, built from the device
#      record in transport/mqtt/topics.ts; a capability that hard-codes one duplicates that knowledge
#      and has to be edited whenever the wire moves. Matches quoted literals only, so prose in a
#      comment is fine.
#
# Single source of truth for this check: package.json `guard:lines` and the CI workflow both run it
# (via `npm run verify`).

#    Matched per hyphen-separated SEGMENT against exact capability ids, so a wire feature whose own name
#    merely contains one (`ff09-autolock` — the auto-lock settings frame, not the `lock` capability) is
#    not a false positive.
