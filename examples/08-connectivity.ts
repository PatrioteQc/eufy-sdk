/**
 * Example 08 — SDK-managed connectivity (battery-aware P2P + read cache).
 *
 * Connectivity is owned by the SDK. A successful `login()` brings up the event channels (push + MQTT)
 * on its own; P2P to a battery camera opens only when a command / stream needs it and detaches when
 * idle. Reads are cached, so polling a device does not wake it. This example passes the (optional)
 * tuning knobs through `loginClient` — including opting a doorbell ring into the speculative pre-warm,
 * which ships off — then shows that events + reads work with no extra setup. Leave it running so a ring
 * pre-warms P2P for an instant live view.
 *
 *   EUFY_EMAIL=you@example.com EUFY_PASSWORD=… node examples/08-connectivity.ts
 *
 * Requires `npm run build` first (imports the built lib from ../dist).
