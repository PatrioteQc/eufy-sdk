/**
 * Example 05 — control a CAMERA's spotlight / floodlight.
 *
 * This is the `light` capability: a light built INTO a camera, driven over the camera's own wire. It is
 * a different product line from the standalone eufy Life smart lights, which use `smartLight()` — see
 * example 09. A device has one or the other, never both.
 *
 * Resolves a device with the `light` capability and drives it via the fluent `light()` accessor:
 * `on()/off()` (or `set(bool)`), plus `setBrightness(1–100)`, `setColorTemp(0 warm–100 cool)` and
 * `setEnabled(bool)` for the master switch. The accessor is `undefined` on a device without a light,
 * so guard with `?.` (or check `dev.has("light")`).
 *
 * Note: on/off ride the level-1 wire and work on standalone cameras. Brightness / colorTemp /
 * master-enable are level-2 (direct-binary) — on a standalone camera with no HomeBase they throw
 * `level-2 key not ready` (see README "Control-command encryption level"). Skipped here unless the
 * key negotiates.
 *
 *   EUFY_EMAIL=… EUFY_PASSWORD=… node examples/05-camera-light.ts <serial> [on|off] [brightness 1-100]
 *
 * Requires `npm run build` first.
