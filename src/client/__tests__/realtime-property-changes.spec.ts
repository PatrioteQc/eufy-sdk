 *
 * Three of the four inbound paths for the security line come through `applyRealtimeState`, and it is
 * also the only inbound path the clean and life lines have: a robot's cloud record carries none of its
 * data points, so before this the entire clean line announced nothing at all beyond `deviceState`.
 *
 * The edge is free here — `applyParams` reports only the properties whose value actually moved — so a
 * device that re-reports the same state repeatedly is silent, without a dedupe table.
