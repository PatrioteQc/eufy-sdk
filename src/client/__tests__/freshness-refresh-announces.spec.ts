/**
 * The read-through freshness refresh as an INBOUND PATH.
 *
 * `getDevice` wires a policy that fires a background cloud re-read when a property is read while stale,
 * and hands the triggering read the stale value. That refresh is, for a host that reads often, the path
 * most fresh cloud values actually arrive on — it fires roughly every `cacheTtlMs`, where the poll fires
 * every ten minutes. So a change it lands is a change the poll will never see afterwards, because live
 * state has already caught up and the poll's own diff is edge-triggered on live state.
 *
 * Leaving it silent therefore does not defer the announcement, it LOSES it: the host is left holding the
 * previous value with nothing telling it to look again, which is the complaint the announcement exists to
 * answer. So this path announces too. Its timing says only when a caller happened to read, which is
 * exactly what the announcement's own docs state about latency — but the VALUE is news either way, and no
 * spurious event is possible, because the announcement is edge-triggered.
 *
 * It also has to apply what the device volunteered over realtime, not only the cloud record's params.
 * The two are kept apart in the registry, so applying the cloud half alone reverts live state for any id
 * a report made fresher — and once the path announces, it would announce that revert.
