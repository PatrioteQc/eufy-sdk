/**
 * Which decoder reads which map-stream channel.
 *
 * This table is the one place the transport's channel numbering meets the model's decoders, and it
 * lives here because this is the only layer that may see both: `model/` is barred from importing
 * `transport/`, which is what stops a decoder from growing an opinion about a topic.
 *
 * **The numbering is a default, not a declaration.** `BIZ_CHANNEL` pairs each channel with its field
 * number in `stream.proto`'s `Metadata.ChanIds`, and a device sending a `Metadata` frame announces its
 * OWN numbering, which may differ. No `Metadata` frame has been observed, and the string `ChanIds`
 * appears nowhere in the decompiled app either — so until a capture settles it this maps by the
 * vendor's shipped default. A device that renumbered would be decoded wrongly and would not look
 * wrong, which is why the risk is written down here rather than left in a commit message.
