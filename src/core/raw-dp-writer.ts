/**
 * Writer for the structured, base64-encoded values some device data points carry in place of a plain
 * scalar — the mirror of the `RawDpCodec` reader in `./contracts.ts`.
 *
 * Every write so far hand-rolled its own bytes, which was tolerable while the only one was two varints
 * in a flat message. It stops being tolerable one level down: a dock command wraps a `oneof` two levels
 * deep, a clean-parameter write nests three, and a room-select carries a repeated sub-message. Building
 * each of those by hand is where silent wire bugs come from — and on a fire-and-forget write, a bad
 * frame is indistinguishable from success.
 *
 * **What this is not.** It is not a protobuf library and does not want to be. There is no schema, no
 * field-name lookup, no wire-type inference from a declared type: the caller states the field number and
 * the shape, exactly as the reader states the field number it wants back. That keeps the model layer
 * free of `protobufjs` (an architecture rule, not a preference — the model layer may not take transport
 * dependencies) and keeps the whole encoder small enough to read in one sitting.
 *
 * **Framing.** {@link RawDpWriter.finish} emits `varint(bodyLength) ++ body`, base64-encoded — the same
 * envelope `RawDpCodec.decode` expects, which is what makes a round-trip through the two a real test.
