/**
 * A camera switched off in the app serves no media, and says so rather than being asked.
 *
 * A disabled camera answers a live start with audio and never a video frame, so a pull that is attempted
 * spends its whole warm-up window and reports `warm-timeout at audio-only` — a stage this codebase documents
 * as an observation and not a diagnosis. `enabled` is the on/off source and states outright that a live probe
 * is not one, so the refusal sits where that reading is held.
 *
 * A reading of `undefined` refuses nothing: families reporting neither wire param leave the state unknown, and
 * unknown is not known-off.
