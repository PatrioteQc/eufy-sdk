/**
 * A description is what turns a callable method into an offerable control, so the rules that keep one
 * from lying are spec'd rather than left to review. What this locks:
 *
 *  1. a description describes a WRITE, never a read-shaped method living on the same object,
 *  2. `reflects` names a real read of the same capability — which for a control is true by construction,
 *     and is checked here because a hand-written description can still get it wrong,
 *  3. a stateful action always reflects something, so a control can show its own state,
 *  4. every argument is described in the published value vocabulary, and a fixed-set argument always has
 *     a domain — on the argument or on the property behind its read,
 *  5. nothing is gated on being described: a module installs more actions than it describes,
 *  6. which modules describe anything is a ratchet — coverage grows by a conscious edit, never by accident,
 *  7. every property the schema publishes as `writable` has a setter a caller can actually reach.
 *
 * Read off a BUILT object, the only place a caller can read it: a control's setter is derived by the
 * barrel and a hand-written one carries its description on the method, so neither exists in the module
 * as a table to inspect. That is also what makes "the described method exists" unfalsifiable here — a
 * renamed method takes its description with it.
