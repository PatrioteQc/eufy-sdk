/**
 * `smart_light` — the `eufy_life` smart-lighting line's baseline (e.g. T8L02 "Permanent Outdoor
 * Lights"). Distinct from the `light` capability (camera floodlight/spotlight control) — this is a
 * different product line on a different transport family (`Codec: "light"`, its own secure-MQTT "DP"
 * TLV wire), not a camera accessory.
 *
 * **Write path (cmd `0x0201` / `0x0206` / `0x020D`):**
 *  - `on`/`off`/`setBrightness` (`setDeviceInfoPayloadData`) — WIRE-CONFIRMED, toggled and dimmed a
 *    real device, and the device's own status report echoes back the brightness that was written.
 *  - `setEffect(lightId)` (`setLightEffectParamsV2PayloadData`) — WIRED. The frame is built from the
 *    fetched gallery-effect catalog entry (layer header/trailer byte-exact vs. real captures); its
 *    per-layer **colours** run through an RGBCW 5-channel approximation of the device's on-device
 *    mixing engine (EXACT on pure primaries, a small mean error on mixed colours). The catalog fetch +
 *    frame serialization happen in the transport (via an injected resolver), keeping this module
 *    transport-neutral.
 *  - `setColor(color)` (`setLightEffectParamsPayloadData`) — WIRE-CONFIRMED on T8L02. This plain
 *    custom-colour path is distinct from gallery effects and preserves configured brightness. The
 *    device does not report authoritative RGB state, so no current-colour getter is exposed.
 *
 * **Read path — TWO inbound frames.** The device pushes an unsolicited `0x0204` status report after
 * every change, and answers a `0x0200` `get_device_info` request with a `0x0A00` reply. They carry the
 * same state but are NOT interchangeable: field widths differ, the reply prefixes a status byte, and
 * the effect mode moves between tags (see {@link FRAME_LAYOUTS}). Both feed the typed getters via
 * `decodeState` and surface as a `smartLightState` event.
 *
 * **The read leg's tag numbers mean DIFFERENT things from the write leg's.** Both run over
 * `0xa1`-`0xae` with unrelated mappings: outbound `a1` is a timestamp and `a2` an account id, while
 * inbound `a1` is power and `a2` brightness. Decoding one leg with the other's table yields plausible,
 * wrong values rather than an error — keep the two tables apart.
