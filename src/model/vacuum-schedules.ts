/**
 * The schedules a robot vacuum holds — `TimerResponse` on DP 164, decoded.
 *
 * The last thing the plan filed under "needs a capture". It did not: the product catalogue named the
 * DP, and the vendor's `timing.proto` had carried the whole message all along. What was missing was
 * only the number joining them, and a `get_product_data_point` dump supplied it.
 *
 * The shape is deeper than anything else on this line — a repeated `TimerInfo`, each with four nested
 * containers and a `oneof` for what the timer actually does — which is why it decodes here rather than
 * as one more field reader inside `vacuum-clean`. It reads a payload and answers a list; it never asks
 * the device for one, and it holds no DP number of its own.
 *
 * **`TimerInfo.Addition` is deliberately not decoded.** It carries the account ids of whoever created
 * and last edited each timer. A host showing a schedule needs the time and the days, not who set it,
 * and the ids are the kind of value this SDK does not put in a caller's hands without a reason.
