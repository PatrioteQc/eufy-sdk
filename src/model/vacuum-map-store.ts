/**
 * One robot's map, assembled from the pieces the device sends separately.
 *
 * The map is not one message. Its geometry and cells arrive on one channel, which cell belongs to
 * which room on a second, the rooms' names and settings on a third, the user's virtual walls on a
 * fourth, and the robot's own position on a fifth — each on its own schedule, and each a whole
 * replacement for the last of its kind rather than a patch. Holding "the map" therefore means holding
 * five things and knowing when they stop belonging together.
 *
 * **That is the entire job here, and it is not bookkeeping.** Every piece carries the `mapId` it
 * belongs to and a `releases` counter that advances whenever the map is edited. A store that ignored
 * them would happily answer a room lookup by indexing last week's room outline with this week's
 * coordinates — a wrong answer that looks exactly like a right one. So a piece from a different map
 * replaces everything, and a piece from an older revision of the same map is dropped.
 *
 * Pure and synchronous: no transport, no clock, no I/O. What arrives is decided by the caller.
