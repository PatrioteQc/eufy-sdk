/**
 * The robot's map, as `stream.proto` describes it — the messages that arrive on the `biz/…/res` leg.
 *
 * Six message types carry everything a caller could want about a map: its size and where it sits in
 * the world, which cell is floor and which is wall, which room each cell belongs to, what those rooms
 * are called and how they are cleaned, and where the user drew a line the robot must not cross. This
 * decodes all six. It does not draw anything: what it hands back is dimensions, coordinates, names and
 * two pixel planes, and a host that wants a picture has everything it needs to paint one. A host given
 * only a picture can never get back to the data.
 *
 * **Units, once, because every coordinate here shares them.** Distances are centimetres — the vendor
 * writes them as "m × 100" throughout — and `resolution` is the width of one cell in those same
 * centimetres, so a cell at `(col, row)` covers world position `origin + (col, row) × resolution`. An
 * angle is radians × 100. Nothing is converted on the way through: a value the device sent as an
 * integer stays one, because dividing it here would make every caller guess whether it had been.
 *
 * **What is deliberately not read.** `RestrictedZone.suggestion` carries zones the robot has *proposed*
 * and the user has not accepted. Merging them into the real lists would report restrictions the robot
 * is not enforcing, and reporting them as fact is worse than not reporting them at all.
