/**
 * The per-run detail blob a {@link CleanRecord} points at — map and statistics for one cleaning run.
 *
 * `get_device_clean_record_list` answers a list of runs, each carrying a `downloadUrl`. The bytes
 * behind that URL are NOT a bare protobuf: they arrive inside the vendor's own container, with a magic
 * header, a length, and a trailing checksum. This owns both halves — unwrapping the container and
 * reading the message inside it — and neither fetches the URL nor decides whether it is safe to.
 *
 * Fetching stays with the caller on purpose: the host these URLs point at is unconfirmed, and this
 * client's binary path is host-allowlisted with SSRF checks by design. Handing the SDK a URL to fetch
 * would route around a control that exists for a reason. A caller that has the bytes can decode them
 * here; a caller that wants the SDK to go and get them is asking for a different, larger decision.

 *
 * Every field defaults to `0` when the message omits it: proto3 omits a zero, so a run that covered no
 * area and one that said nothing about area are the same bytes, and `0` is the honest reading of both.
 * `finishReason` is the exception — an index this version cannot name answers `undefined` rather than
 * being flattened onto a neighbouring reason.
 *
 * Returns `undefined` when the container fails its checksum or the bytes inside are not a message —
 * never throws, and never a partial read.
 *
 * **`Extra` is not decoded.** The message carries a nested `Extra { mode, mus, error_code, prompt_code }`
 * whose own field number within `CleanRecordDesc` is not recorded in any source this SDK can point at.
