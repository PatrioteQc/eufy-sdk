/**
 * Direct-binary write helpers.
 *
 * The capability-driven command recipes live in the capability modules
 * (`src/model/capabilities/*`): each module owns its own `buildCommand`, and the barrel's
 * `buildCommand()` resolves across them. This file keeps ONLY the **direct-binary** body builder
 * — a packed struct, not a JSON recipe — used by `EufyMega.sendDirectBinary` for camera on/off +
 * spotlight brightness/color-temp/enable. No dependency on the capability barrel (avoids a cycle).

/**
 * Build the packed binary body for a "direct" control command — TWO shapes, one layout. The tail is
 * always `[uint32 LE value][account_id ASCII pad→128]`; they differ only by an optional leading
 * channel word:
 *  - **device form** (pass `channel`): `[uint32 LE channel][uint32 LE value][account_id @8]` = **136B**
 *    — camera on/off `1035`, spotlight brightness `1401` / color-temp `1410` / enable `1403`, etc.
 *  - **station form** (omit `channel`): `[uint32 LE value][account_id @4]` = **132B** — a HomeBase
 *    station-scoped scalar (alarm/speaker volume `1235`); the hub is addressed by the outer frame
 *    channel 255, so there is no leading channel word.
 *
 * Both forms are wire-verified live (T8214 camera / T8030 hub audible test tone). `account_id` is
 * **sliced to 128** (`Buffer.write` would otherwise silently truncate) and must be **non-empty** —
 * an all-zero account field is rejected by the HomeBase and the caller's fallback chain can resolve
 * to `""`, so we fail loud instead.
