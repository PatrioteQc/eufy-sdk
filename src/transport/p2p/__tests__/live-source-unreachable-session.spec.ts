/**
 * A media start the device never acknowledged says the session is not being heard, not that the device is slow.
 *
 * The start is repeated byte-identically every 150 ms and abandoned after three seconds, so an abandonment is
 * roughly twenty sends with no reply — against acknowledgement latencies of 4–37 ms from an awake camera and
 * 238 ms from one still waking. `P2PSession` already states the consequence: the camera was never told to
 * stream, so the warm-up that follows can only ever time out.
 *
 * It was left to time out anyway. Measured on a real camera: five starts, five abandonments, and a
 * `source-error` twenty seconds after a first abandonment at three that carried the whole answer. The next
 * attempt rebuilt the session and delivered a keyframe 5.9 s later — inside the window the first attempt spent
 * re-issuing onto a session nothing was listening to.
 *
 * So the first abandonment asks the owner for a replacement session and warms again on it, once, keeping the
 * deadline the first attempt started. An abandonment after media has flowed says something else and is left
 * alone, and a source with no owner to ask keeps re-issuing as before.
