 * correct for best-effort media, which proceeds at level-1 — but a command whose only wire is level-2 is then

 *
 * Measured: an own-session camera whose power rides the level-2 privacy envelope refused `setEnabled` with
 * "level-2 key not ready" and stayed refused, leaving the camera switched off; opening a stream built a new
 * session, which negotiated (cipher id observed) and let the same write through immediately.
