 * What the router hands each media egress, and why an omission there is never cosmetic.

 * with no `ffmpeg` on `PATH` is the case that option exists for, so a leg that keeps the bare name makes
 * that egress unavailable), and the session TOPOLOGY (`homeBaseAttached`), which decides both how a
 * stream is started and whether it may trust the station's per-camera frame tag. `../media.js` is mocked
