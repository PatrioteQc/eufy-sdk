/**
 * `record` must always settle.
 *
 * Its clip used to end only inside a `video` handler — on the first frame to arrive at or past the wall clock —
 * so a camera that went quiet mid-clip left the promise pending for the life of the process. This module's own
 * history records exactly that: an own-session camera that stopped 13.6 s into a stream with no `stop` and no
 * `error`. The stream's `error` was swallowed by an empty handler on the same path, so an upstream failure was
 * discarded rather than reported.
 *
 * These specs pin the three ways the call now ends: the window elapsing, the session going away under it, and
 * the stream reporting a failure.
