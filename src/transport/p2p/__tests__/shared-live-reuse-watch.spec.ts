/**
 * A source reused inside its linger window is watched like any other.
 *
 * The linger keeps a stream alive after its last consumer leaves, so re-opening the same camera costs nothing.
 * It also keeps the last keyframe, which a joining consumer is primed with so it decodes without waiting a
 * whole group of pictures.
 *
 * Together those two made a silent failure: a consumer joining a lingering source is handed a cached keyframe
 * at once, so a caller sees media and commits to it — an adaptation process, a negotiated HomeKit session —
 * while the stream underneath may already have stopped being served. Warming was the only thing that armed a
 * deadline, and reuse skips warming by definition, so nothing ever timed out. Observed on a real account as a
 * 30 s HomeKit timeout whose whole trace was one primed keyframe and then silence, where the retry that
 * followed rebuilt the stream and reached its first output in 0.69 s.
 *
 * A primed keyframe is evidence about the past. Only a frame that arrives after the join says the stream is
 * still being served.
