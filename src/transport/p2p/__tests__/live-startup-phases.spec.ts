/**
 * The wait before any media command is sent, as structured phases.
 *
 * These facts were only ever free text, and a consumer's diagnostics cannot keep free text: a station identity
 * inside it survives every pattern a redactor recognises. So the numbers a slow start is diagnosed from — how
 * long a start may wait for the level-2 key, what the key negotiation answered, the interval a warm-up
 * re-issues on and the deadline it fails at — were unreachable to a host, which left it reading keyword
 * buckets and concluding wrongly.
 *
 * Each field is a bounded integer, which is what makes the phase safe to retain rather than merely useful.
