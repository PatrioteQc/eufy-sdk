/**
 * Raw-DP codec — the structural reader for the base64 protobuf values a Tuya-style data point carries
 * when it holds a whole message instead of a scalar. Implements the `core/contracts` {@link RawDpCodec}
 * boundary, so the capability layer can read those DPs without importing `protobufjs`, which the
 * decorrelation guard bars from `model/`.
 *
 * Schema-less by construction. It walks fields by number and wire type and hands back what it finds; it
 * never learns which DP a payload came from, what a field means, or whether a length-delimited run is a
 * UTF-8 string, an opaque blob or a nested message. That is the reader's call, and the reader is the
 * capability — the same split `DpInboundFrame` already draws for inbound TLV frames.
 *
 * ## Wire (confirmed against a T2351 over AIoT MQTT)
 *
 * A Raw DP's value is `base64( varint(len) ++ protobufMessage )` — the length prefix is the exact byte
 * length of the message that follows, so it doubles as a validity check: a value whose prefix disagrees
 * with the remaining body is not this shape and is rejected rather than half-read. Standard protobuf
 * wire types are handled (`0` varint, `1` fixed64, `2` length-delimited, `5` fixed32); a group marker
 * (`3`/`4`) or a reserved `6`/`7` rejects the whole payload — none appears in any captured DP, and
 * guessing past one would silently misalign every field after it.
 *
 * `Buffer.from(_, "base64")` never throws (it drops invalid characters silently), so a non-base64 string
 * decodes to bytes whose length prefix will not match and is rejected by that same check.
 *
 * Varints are read UNSIGNED, because the wire does not say otherwise: a negative `int32`/`int64` is
 * encoded as a 10-byte varint and surfaces here as a very large `bigint`, and `sint32`/`sint64` values
 * arrive still zig-zag encoded. Recovering either needs the field's declared type, which only the
 * capability naming that field has. No DP read today has a signed field; one that does converts on its
 * own side.
 *
 * Pure and stateless — no socket, no session — so it sits at the transport root beside `ff09.ts` and is
 * imported by direct path rather than re-exported from the barrel.
