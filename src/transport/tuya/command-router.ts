/**
 * `TuyaCommandRouter` — the transport-side command router for eufy Home/Clean Tuya vacuums (X8,
 * G-series and other `eufy_home_tuya` category devices).
 *
 * Usage: call {@link bind} after a successful mega login, then {@link registerDevice} for each
 * `eufy_home_tuya` device (the facade does both). On the first {@link dispatchCommand} the router
 * logs into the Tuya cloud lazily (once, shared across all subsequent sends). The dp.publish write
 * is sent via `TuyaClient.publishDps` — note the `dp.publish` param shape is not yet confirmed from
 * a live eufy Home/Clean capture (gated by {@link TuyaCommandRouterConfig.allowUnverified}, default `false`).
 *
 * Layering: imports `../../core` only — no `model/` import, consistent with the capability↔transport
 * decorrelation invariant. Sibling tuya/* imports are same-layer (transport).
