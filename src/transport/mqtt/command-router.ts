/**
 * MQTT command router — the transport-side owner of the secure-MQTT command path: maps a
 * transport-neutral {@link Command} to its MQTT wire + envelope over a one-shot connection per command.
 * The MQTT sibling of `transport/p2p/command-router.ts`'s `P2PCommandRouter`.
 *
 * The MQTT-bound kinds are `ff09-*` (`ff09-actuate` — a single fire-and-forget frame; `ff09-autolock`
 * — a GET-then-SET read-modify-write) and `mqtt-dp`/`mqtt-dp-color`/`mqtt-dp-preset` (the `eufy_life` DP TLV writes
 * behind the T8L0x smart lights), routed here when a device's stack is MQTT (see {@link claimsDevice}).
 * A future command family (another frame, another protocol) is one more {@link dispatchCommand} branch
 * — nothing here is ff09-only by design.
 *
 * Layering: this module knows MQTT bytes; it does NOT know capabilities. Capability modules emit a
 * transport-neutral {@link Command}; the facade fans it out by `kind` + topology to this router or the
 * P2P one. This keeps transport free of any `model/` import — the capability↔transport decorrelation
 * invariant.
 *
 * Two connection strategies live here, matched to what each wire was verified over:
 *  - **ff09** opens its OWN one-shot, explicitly non-reconnecting `SecureMqtt` pinned to the broker
 *    instance that holds the device's session (see {@link ensureSecurityMqttFor}) and tears it down
 *    right after — the lock/garage path needs the SUBSCRIBE-and-wait ack machinery.
 *  - **eufy_life DP** (lights) publishes fire-and-forget over the facade's persistent account-wide
 *    `this.transport` via the injected {@link MqttRouterDeps.publishSecure} — that persistent connection
 *    is the CONFIRMED light-write path (`connectMQTT()` then publish to `.../req`), owned by the facade.

   * signal at all for actuation completion — that would need a different source, e.g. the device's own
   * state push — so this method stays fire-and-forget: it resolves either way, never throws on a missing
   * ack, and reports what it knows via the `commandAck` event rather than the return value, so a future
   * richer per-device state model doesn't have to fight this method's `Promise<void>` contract.)
   *
   * Subscribes to the reply topic BEFORE publishing and waits for the actual message event (or the
   * timeout) rather than a blind sleep, so a reply arriving anywhere in that window is never missed —
   * unlike a fixed-sleep-then-teardown, where a late reply arrives after the subscription is already gone.

  /**
   * The `ff09-autolock` intent handler over MQTT — read-modify-write the T85D0's auto-lock setting.
   * ✅ LIVE-VERIFIED end-to-end (2026-07-17): both enable and disable
   * driven through this exact codepath against a real T85D0, confirmed via the app UI showing the new
   * state afterward, not just byte-exact against a capture. Unlike {@link dispatchFf09Actuate} (one
   * fire-and-forget frame), this is a GET then a SET over the SAME one-shot MQTT connection:
   *
   *  1. Publish a settings GET query ({@link buildFf09QueryTrans}), then wait for the device's `/res`
   *     reply — NOT the generic "any /res" ack {@link dispatchFf09Actuate} accepts, but specifically a
   *     message matching {@link parseFf09SettingsResponseTrans}'s shape whose `time` (hex string,
   *     parsed as the keyTime) equals the GET's own `time`, so unrelated traffic on the same
   *     subscription can't be mistaken for the reply. **No reply within the timeout throws** — unlike
   *     lock/unlock, this is a genuine precondition (we need the device's live `A7`/`A8`/delay values
   *     to preserve them), not a fire-and-forget actuation, so silently guess-writing would be worse
   *     than failing loud.
   *  2+3. Decrypt the reply, preserve the current delay (`a2`) + `A7`/`A8` passthrough values (`a4`/
   *     `a5`), and build the SET frame that changes only `A4`=`cmd.enabled` / `A5`=`cmd.delaySeconds`
   *     (or the just-read delay if omitted) — the decrypt→read→rebuild is shared with the P2P sibling in
   *     `transport/ff09.ts`'s {@link buildFf09AutolockSetFrame}; here it's wrapped in the MQTT `trans`
   *     envelope and published. Its ack follows the same fire-and-forget device-scoped `/res` convention
   *     as {@link dispatchFf09Actuate} —
   *     there's no captured evidence of a distinct SET-ack shape to match more strictly against. This
   *     listener is armed fresh (topic-only match, no keyTime correlation like step 1's), so in theory a
   *     REDELIVERED copy of the already-consumed GET reply (QoS-1 retransmit) could latch it early —
   *     telemetry-only (the call resolves either way; `setAcked` only affects a debug log line), so left
   *     as-is rather than adding keyTime correlation this ack doesn't otherwise need.
