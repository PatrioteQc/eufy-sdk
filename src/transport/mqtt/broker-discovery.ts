/**
 * Garage/lock broker-INSTANCE discovery — reachability probing without ever publishing a command.
 *
 * `aiot-mqtt-{region}.anker.com` resolves through an AWS NLB (`…-nlb2-….elb.{region}.amazonaws.com`,
 * confirmed via `dig`) to one IP per AZ. The brokers behind those targets do NOT share subscribe/publish
 * routing state — a device's live session lives on exactly one target at a time. Landing on the wrong
 * one still completes the TLS CONNECT (same cert-trust chain everywhere) but denies SUBSCRIBE for that
 * device's topic (SUBACK return code 0x80). A granted SUBSCRIBE is a reliable proxy for "this instance
 * holds the device's session" — confirmed live: a real actuation only ever succeeded on an instance
 * that had already granted the SUBSCRIBE. That means we can find the right instance with SUBSCRIBE
 * alone — no PUBLISH is required to tell instances apart, so this module never sends one.
