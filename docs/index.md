These guides cover **how to use** the SDK.

::: warning Under construction
The repository is being set up. The guides land with the first source release — for now there is only
the generated [API reference](/api/).

## An SDK, not an app

eufy-sdk is a building block for developers. There is no UI, no dashboard, and nothing here to
install as an end user — it's the layer an integration is built _on_.

If you arrived here from something you installed in a smart-home platform, its maintainer is the
right first stop. They own what you actually see and click, they chose how to use this SDK, and
they're the ones who can tell whether a problem is theirs or ours. Coming here first usually costs
you a round trip.

Building that integration yourself? Then you're in the right place.

## Independent project

eufy-sdk is an independent, unofficial SDK. It is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored
by Anker Innovations or eufy**, and it is not a product of either company — no support, warranty, or
service commitment here comes from them.

"eufy", "Anker", and the device names and model codes used across these guides are trademarks of
their respective owners. They appear here only to identify the hardware this SDK talks to.

Use it with devices on your own account. Rapid or failed logins can trigger a captcha or a temporary
cooldown.
